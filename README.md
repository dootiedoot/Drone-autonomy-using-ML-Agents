# Drone-autonomy-using-ML-Agents
Using Unity's ML Agents to teach a virtual drone to fly and do tasks using reinforcement learning.

# Examples
## Basic quad copter learning to hover example
#### Each sphere on the drone corners can exert either variable amounts of upward or downward force to hover.

## Irregular quad copter learning to hover example (with player nudging test)
#### Each arm on the drone has been randomly rotated/scaled. Forces are still only in either a upward or downward direction.

## Drone attempting to land on a platform
